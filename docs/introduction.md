# PCGL Molecular Data Submission Workflow: Introduction

---

## Overview

The Pan-Canadian Genome Library (PCGL) [Molecular Data Submission Workflow](https://github.com/Pan-Canadian-Genome-Library/molecular-data-submission-workflow) is a Nextflow-based pipeline that **simplifies and automates** the submission of molecular genomics data to the PCGL repository. The workflow has adopted [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) framework and best practice guidelines to ensure reproducibility, portability and scalability.

### What This Workflow Does For You

✅ **Validates your data** before submission to catch errors early  
✅ **Automates complex submission steps** reducing manual work from days to hours  
✅ **Ensures compliance** with PCGL data model and requirements  
✅ **Provides clear feedback** with detailed reports on success/failure status  
✅ **Handles large-scale submissions** efficiently with batch and parallel processing  
✅ **Maintains audit trails** for regulatory compliance and tracking  

### Supported Data Types

This workflow supports submission of:
- **Genomic Data**: WGS, WES, RNA-Seq, Panel sequencing
- **File Formats**: CRAM, BAM, VCF, BCF (with corresponding index files)
- **Analysis Types**: Variant calling, Alignment, Raw Sequencing Reads
- **Metadata**: Biospecimen and Analysis Entities 

### What to Expect

**Terminal Output Behavior:**
- **Parameter Display**: Workflow begins by showing all input parameters and configuration settings
- **Real-time Process Execution**: Live updates as each pipeline process runs, with progress indicators
- **Process Status**: Clear indication of which step is currently executing (e.g., validation, upload, receipt generation)
- **Completion Summary**: Successful runs conclude with a comprehensive summary of submitted analyses
- **Early Termination**: Critical issues trigger immediate workflow termination with clear error messages

**Processing Characteristics:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple samples are processed simultaneously for efficiency
- **Fault Tolerance**: Individual sample failures don't stop the entire batch
- **Resource Scaling**: Performance varies based on system resources and data size

**Timing Expectations:**
- **Parallel Processing**: Most workflow processes run in parallel across samples, significantly reducing overall submission time
- **Variable Completion Times**: Duration depends on multiple factors:
  - **File sizes**: Larger genomic files take longer to process and upload
  - **Parallel resources**: Number of concurrent jobs affects speed across all workflow stages
  - **Network throughput**: Available bandwidth impacts transfer rates
  - **System resources**: CPU, memory, and storage I/O capabilities affect all processing steps
- **Small batches (1-10 samples)**: Minutes to hours depending on factors above
- **Large batches (100+ samples)**: Hours to days depending on factors above

   - Confirm workflow executes successfully in your environment
   - Familiarize yourself with the process using safe test data

4. **📤 Submit Real Data**
   - Start with a **small batch (1-2 samples)** following [Usage Guide](usage.md)
   - Monitor the submission process and verify success
   - Scale up to larger batches once comfortable with the workflow

5. **📊 Review Results**
   - Understand your outputs using [Output Documentation](output.md)
   - Interpret submission status with [Receipt Guide](Receipt.md)
   - Keep receipts for audit trails and future reference

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Always test with a small batch before submitting large datasets. This helps identify any issues early and ensures you understand the process.
